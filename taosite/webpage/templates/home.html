          <h5>WHAT IS THE TAO?</h5>
          <p>The Tao that can be understood<br>
            is not the eternal, cosmic Tao,<br>
            just as an idea that can be expressed in words<br>
            is not the infinite idea.</p>
          <p>And yet this ineffable Tao<br>
            is the source of all spirit and matter;<br>
            expressing itself,<br>
            it is the mother of all created things.</p>
          <p>Not to desire material things<br>
            is to know the freedom of spirituality;<br>
            and to desire them is to suffer<br>
            the limitations of matter.</p>
          <p>Yet these two things, matter and spirit,<br>
            so different in nature, have the same origin.</p>
          <p>This unity is the mystery of mysteries,<br>
            and the gateway to spirituality.</p>

          <h5>OPPOSITES</h5>
          <p>When beauty is only a masquerade,<br>
            it is actually ugliness.<br>
            And goodness, if it is not sincere,<br>
            is not really goodness.</p>
          <p>Existence and nonexistence are incompatible.<br>
          The difficult and the easy are mutually opposed.<br>
          The long and the short, the high and the low,<br>
          the loud and soft, the before and after--<br>
          all are opposites.<br>
          Each reveals the other.</p>
          <p>The wise are not conspicuous in their actions<br>
            or given to much talking.<br>
            When troubles arise,<br>
            they are not irritated.</p>
          <p>They produce, but do not hoard,<br>
            They act, but expect no praise,<br>
            They build, but do not dwell therein.</p>
          <p>And because they do not dwell therein,<br>
            they never depart.</p>

          <h5>RESTRAINT</h5>
          <p>When a ruler is silent on the subject of virtue,<br>
            the people are discouraged from practicing it.<br>
            Meanwhile, a ruler who revels in riches encourages thievery.</p>
          <p>Value virtue over wealth,<br>
            and the people's hearts will be at rest.</p>
          <p>Wise rulers do not accumulate treasures,<br>
            but seek to quiet the hearts of their people.<br>
            They soothe the people's appetites and strengthen their bones.<br>
            They treasure innocence, and protect the simple from the schemes of the clever.</p>
          <p>When a ruler practices restraint, everything will be in place.</p>

            It existed before anything.</p>
            <p>It dulls its own sharpness,<br>

            <p>The reason the universe and earth are eternal and lasting<br>
            is they do not exist for themselves.<br>

            and because of their humility, they are worthy of praise.</p>
            <p>They put others first, and so become great.</p>

            Like water, it ever seeks the lowest place,<br>

            <p>This is the way of the Tao.<br>

          <p>Everything, if not for life, would dissipate.<br>
            Rulers, if they overestimate themselves, will fail.</p>
          <p>Nobles should find their roots among the commoners,<br>
            for the high is always founded upon the low.</p>
          <p>Great rulers identify with orphans, inferiors,<br>

        <h5>LIFE WITHOUT LIMITS</h5>
          <p>In ruling and in life,<br>
            nothing surpasses moderation.</p>
          <p>One must form the habit early.<br>
            Acquiring moderation results in accumulating virtue.<br>
            By accumulating virtue, nothing is impossible.</p>
          <p>If nothing is impossible, one knows no limits.<br>
            If one knows no limits, one may rule the empire.</p>
          <p>Those who possess moderation will endure;<br>
            they have deep roots and strong stems.</p>
          <p>This is the secret to a long life,<br>
          and lasting insight into the Tao.</p>

            simply, boldly, without fear.</p>
          <p>By following the Tao,<br>

          <p>Just as a woman, through cheerful and able service,<br>
            wins control over a man,<br>

            wins their allegiance;<br>
            and so a small state, by yielding to a great state,<br>
            wins influence over it.</p>
          <p>Some submit to a conqueror,<br>
            others conquer by submitting.</p>
          <p>Great states have no higher purpose<br>

            Small states have no higher purpose<br>
            than to enter a federation and serve the people.</p>
          <p>They have different ends;<br>
            but to achieve them.<br>
            both must practice submission.</p>

        <h5>THE SAVING TAO</h5>
          <p>The Tao is the sanctuary of all--<br>
            it is the good person's treasure,<br>
            and the bad person's last resort.</p>
          <p>Beautiful words may sell goods,<br>
            but it takes kind actions to save people.</p>
          <p>Why should people be put to death for their mistakes?<br>
            Even criminals can reform.</p>
          <p>Better than riding a horse in the emperor's entourage,<br>
            is sitting and teaching the Tao to those who need it most.</p>
          <p>The ancients esteemed the Tao<br>
            because those who seek it will find it,<br>
            and by it sinners can be saved.</p>
          <p>Is it not so?<br>
            This is why the world honors the Tao.</p>

          <p>The wise stay out of great affairs,<br>

            That which is weak is easily broken;<br>

          <p>Try to re-shape a thing, and you will deface it;<br>
            try to control it, and you will lose it.</p>
          <p>The wise, accepting things as they are, deface nothing.<br>
            Not seizing things, they do not lose them.<br>
            While others, in their mad rush for wealth,<br>
            are always chasing success but coming up short.</p>
          <p>To succeed, be as attentive at the end of an enterprise<br>

          <p>The wise do not desire what they do not possess.<br>
            They learn to be unlearned;<br>
            they attend to that which others ignore.</p>
          <p>In that spirit, they help things grow,<br>

        <h5>PROFOUND SIMPLICITY</h5>
          <p>In ancient times, rulers who followed the Tao<br>
            did not puff up the people,<br>
            but kept them simple-hearted.</p>
          <p>Clever people are difficult to govern.<br>
            And so, governing people with cleverness is a mistake,<br>
            while governing people with simplicity is a blessing to all.</p>
          <p>Rulers who follow this become good models.<br>
            This is governing in the spirit of the Tao.</p>
          <p>The effects of simplicity are profound indeed,<br>
            deep and far reaching.<br>
            It is the very opposite of common governing,<br>

        <h5>COMPASSION</h5>
          <p>The Tao is by nature immaterial,<br>
            yet all the world calls it great.<br>
            It is because the Tao does not put on appearances<br>
            that it is great.</p>
          <p>When a person puts on a show,<br>

            their mediocrity is soon exposed.</p>
          <p>The Tao has three treasures<br>
            which the wise guard and cherish:<br>
            The first is compassion,<br>
            the second is economy,<br>
            the third is humility.</p>
          <p>If you are compassionate, you can be truly courageous;<br>
            if you are economical, you can be truly generous;<br>
            if you are humble, you can be truly helpful.</p>
          <p>If you are brave but lack compassion,<br>
            are generous but lack economy,<br>
            and try to help others but lack humility,<br>
            you've lost the way.</p>

            I hesitate to advance an inch,<br>

          <p>This is advancing by not advancing;<br>
            it is winning without weapons;<br>
            it is charging without rage;<br>
            it is seizing without force.</p>
          <p>There is no mistake greater<br>
            than making light of an enemy.<br>
            Through overconfidence,<br>
            we make ourselves vulnerable.</p>

            the one that is aware of its own weakness conquers.</p>
